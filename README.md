# Java-OOP-and-projects
Here are some of the Initial 'Object Oriented Programming' 
projects I completed in Java in 2016. I took this course at 
Brooklyn Technical High Shool in my Junior Year. 

## Games
### Guessing Game
This is an elementary game where users guess a number. The
guessing gets more challenging based on levels; it goes from
level 1 to level 4. 
### Password Generator 
It randomly generates strong passwords for users to use and 
then exports it as a text file.
